Project Overview: Python-based Jupyter Notebook data analysis for Indian Startup

In this project, we'll examine startup data from India to discover trends and insights that could guide future business owners in making wiser choices. The information about Indian startups in the data, which was gathered through Kaggle, includes their name, industry, location, funding, and status. To do the analysis, Jupyter Notebook and Python will be used.

1. To list the most prevalent industries for Indian entrepreneurs.
2. To examine how Indian startups are funded.
3. To identify India's prime startup areas.
4. To list the most well-funded startups in India.
5. To spot trends and patterns in the ecosystem of Indian startups.

Methodology:
1. Cleaning the data: We will purge the data of unnecessary columns and deal with missing values.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): To understand the data and spot patterns and trends, we shall do EDA.
3. Data Visualisation: To show our findings, we'll make use of visualisations including bar graphs, line graphs, and scatter plots.
4. Statistical Analysis: To find connections and trends in the data, statistical analysis will be used.

Tools Applied
1. Python: Python will be used to analyse and visualise data.
2. Jupyter Notebook: To write and run our code, we'll use Jupyter Notebook.
3. Pandas: Pandas will be used to clean and manipulate data.
4. Matplotlib: To visualise data, we'll use Matplotlib.
5. Seaborn: For advanced data visualisation, we'll use Seaborn.

At the conclusion of this project, we hope to obtain knowledge of the Indian startup environment, spot patterns and trends, and offer advice to aspiring business owners. We anticipate that this project will assist business owners in making wiser decisions and support the expansion of the Indian startup ecosystem.

In order to provide information and trends to potential business owners, this initiative will analyse startup data from India. We will undertake data cleansing, exploratory data analysis, data visualisation, and statistical analysis using Python and Jupyter Notebook to learn more about the data. We anticipate that this effort will help the Indian startup ecosystem develop.
